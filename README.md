Advent of Code 2019
-------------------

Here's where I'll be collecting my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) puzzles!

Unless otherwise specified, all the scripts will be in Python 3.7 and obviously the inputs are specific to me.

Huge thanks to [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) for putting this puzzle together every year. It's a ton of fun.
